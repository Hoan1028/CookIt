## CookIt
This is a repository for the IS385 - Systems Analysis and Design project completed by Hoan Nguyen, Victor Le, Felix Huang, John Nguyen, Joji Maldonado and Josue Cruz. The project's aim was to think of a problem and design an application that fulfills the client's needs.

## Project Description
View the project prompt [here](https://github.com/Hoan1028/CookIt/blob/master/Project%20Description%20Fall%202018.pdf).

The Cookit! Application came as a result from a brainstorm for problems that could be solved by a system or application. 
Our group research found that many households in America see a declining trend in homecooked meals. 
Eating out incurs higher financial costs, limits control over nutrition, and strips away independence.
We solve these issues by identifying factors that influence people's choice to eat out rather than going to the grocery and 
cooking meals at home, and designing a system that makes the process of cooking a meal at home easier. Cookit! not only creates a list
of meals based on dietary restrictions, calculates a summation of nutritional data that helps users keep track of their eating
habits, but it also creates a system where users can easily order their meals with preset ingredients from their preferred local grocery for pick-up.

A full report and documentation of the system can be found [here](https://github.com/Hoan1028/CookIt/blob/master/Cookit_Documentation%26Report.pdf).
